- badge and region comparisons are not registering "None" as correct (green) if both the guessed and target company both have no badges
- partial correct answers are not working. it should be that for properties that are lists/arrays, if there are overlapping elements with the target company and the guessed company within that property, for example badge, then make it yellow
- normalize badges and names (i.e. topCompany --> Top Company), normalize regions and remove "remote" and "partially remote"
- make sure to put "Not affiliated with YC"
- tile outlines should be in this format: the outline is brighter and the inside is a darker versions of the same colour
- company tile switch with company logo instead of company name
- larger font within tiles
- do not use arrow emoji, it should just be a background arrow image thats a darker colour of the background colour
- make wordle guess as a revealing tile animation (flip and reveal for each tile)


- make sure to add a legend to explain what each colour means


- create tests: generate me tests i can do to ensure proper game?
